	Welcome to DEATHDROP, gurl!  For (probably not) the first time in HERSTORY, it's the Hangman variant that has you guessing drag queens from RuPaul's Drag Race.  Guess the right letter or Laganja may hit the floor!  I know it sounds sickening but no one has swept for at least a week.  Help a sister out by completing the phrase.
</p>
<p>Click on either "Easy Mode" or "Hard Mode" to get started. You can guess the wrong letter 9 times before your girl's wig and costume get dirty. When you have finished the game, you'll get a new queen to guess!</p>
